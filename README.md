# MusicGuru-RNN-Composer
An assignment in a course to develop an RNN with theano to make the computer learn to compose music in midi format.

###An home work assignment in a course to develop a Recurrent neural network that can create new data after training.
 We trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network on different Data sets of midi files. afterwerd we sampled from the created model to generate new musical pieces.

## Introduction
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are popular models that have shown great promise in many NLP tasks. but despite their recent popularity in the field of text analysis they can be used in many other fields like the use google dose with them in the field of computer vision.
in this work we are trying to train the computer to compose music which is as well a trainable thing just as painiting or writing correctly.

This post assumes a familiarity with machine learning and neural networks. For a good overview of RNN's, I highly recommend reading Andrej Karpathy's excellent blog post here for an in-depth explanation.
